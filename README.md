2.	Limited Attempts: The player has only 5 attempts to guess the correct number.
3.	User Input: The player enters their guess using a text entry widget provided by Tkinter.
4.	Feedback Messages: The game provides feedback messages to the player after each guess, indicating whether the guess is correct, too high, or too low.
5.	GUI Interface: The game has a simple GUI with labels, entry fields, and buttons for a user-friendly experience.
